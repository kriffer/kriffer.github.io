My name is Anton Kravets aka kriffer. I am a software engineer, like Python, Linux and overall free software. 
This blog contains my thoughts about Python and stuff related to it that come into mind while working on them. All ideas and code 
are presented as is so if you find them useful I would be happy.

You can find all of the source code at GitHub:
